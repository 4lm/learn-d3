# Customizing Axes of a Bar Chart!

This project is modelled after a [d3 tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3MCROTNN8g) from Curran Kelleher.

This bar chart shows population of the top 10 most populous countries. The data comes from the year 2018 estimate in [United Nations: World Population Prospects 2017](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/).
